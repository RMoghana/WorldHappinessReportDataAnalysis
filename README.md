# WorldHappinessReportDataAnalysis
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The report which is released annually continues to gain global recognition and BCM Ltd, a financial institution recently set up, and wants to use the happiness indicators in its policy-making decisions with regards to its cross border activities. 
However, the reports are downloaded and compiled manually and this manual process is very error prone.
Hence Jupyter notebook has been used to implement an automated data pipeline that will provide a better and more efficient way of collating and processing the data.

WorldHappinessReportDataAnalysis.ipynb contains all the coding for Task 1 to Task 6.

Task 1:
The database and tables were creating by importing sqlite3 library.
Database file: ‘worldHappinessData.db’.

Task 2:
All data are saved in tables ‘TblCountrydetails’ and ‘TblWorldHappiness_data’.

Output for task 3 is in folder ‘ModellingRecordsForTask3’.

Output for task 4 is in folder ‘Task4’

Task 5:
A choropleth map has been generated by plotting the data in a world map showing the evolution by year.

Output for task 6 is in csv file ‘TaskSixMergedData.csv’
